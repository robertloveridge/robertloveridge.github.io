How many times have you gone to a website, or received an email and it's full of "click here" links?!

A lot of the time, "click here" links can be really misleading and add to the confusion for your end users.

One of the primary reasons you have a website or you've sent an email is because you want someone to do something - help them by making your links clear and "tell" the end user where a link will take them and why they should click it.

There are different types of links you might have on your website or in your email:

 * Internal links - links that go to somewhere else on your website
 * External links - links that go to another website
 * Download links - when a user clicks on this, a file download is started directly in the browser
 * Mail-to links - when a user clicks on this, they're usually going to get a 'New email' pop-up open in their default mail client

All of the above can benefit from a few simple tweaks. Here are some of the things I would encourage people to do when building their websites or emails - do it with a view of reducing the use of "click here" links and giving end users a better experience.

## Use descriptive wording for link text

The more information you can give in your link text, the better. Your end users won't have to think as much. For example, in a sentence "Why not download our marketing report today?" linking to the words "download our marketing report" is much better than linking the single word "download" or "report".

The first option gives the user more insight into what they can expect when and if they click on the link. Caveat here is that I'd steer clear from very long links - they get too wordy and again, can make things difficult for the end user.

## Use some colours

If your users have been to your website before, they might have previously clicked on an unhelpful link - don't let them waste their time on it again.

Use different colours for visited and unvisited links. Once they've got to grips with the colours you're using to represent different links, it'll make their journey through your website much easier.

## Use adjacent information

Wouldn't it be better if we told the user that the marketing report was a PDF, a Word document or something else? How about the size of the document? Put some text at the side to let them know. For example, 'Why not download our marketing report today? (1.3MB PDF)'.

You can also add even more here - if an icon of a Word document or a PDF is something that most of your user will recognise, then use that too to help them.

## Use some standard HTML attributes

The `alt` and `title` attributes are great for providing extra information to the end user. You might not want to make your links too long but still want to provide details about the link (it's a PDF). You can use these attributes to help with that.

That's all I've got to say on this one. I know I am probably guilty of not always following these tips but I try!
