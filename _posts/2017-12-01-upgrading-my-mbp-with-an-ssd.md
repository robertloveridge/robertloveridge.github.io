I noticed my MBP grinding to a halt and becoming frustratingly slow, so I decided to do a bit of an upgrade on the hard drive and hoped that this would solve the problem.

I bought a [Crucial BX300 120GB SSD](http://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/ct120bx300ssd1) and used that for the upgrade. Having less space wasn't an issue as I use [a Nifty drive](https://www.bynifty.com/) for storage.

Here are the 4 steps I took to do the upgrade.

## WARNING!

> If you haven't ever tinkered with the insides of a computer, this probably isn't for you. I'd get someone else with experience to do it for you. You probably want to back up your files too!

## Tools Needed

 * 00 Phillips Screwdriver
 * T6 Torx Screwdriver

## Step 1 - Remove the bottom of the MBP

Use the philips screwdriver to remove all 10 screws securing the bottom of the MBP. Start with the 3 in the top-right-corner - they're longer (13.5 mm) than the other 7 (3 mm) screws.

Once the screws are removed, lift the bottom case and push it toward the rear of the MBP to release it.

## Step 2 - Locate and remove the old hard drive

You should be able to see the hard drive located in the bottom-left-corner.

Remove the two phillips screws securing the hard drive bracket to the MBP. The screws won't come all the way out, so it's okay if they stay in the black retaining bar.

Lift the hard drive using the pull tab and pull it out of the chassis - be careful because there's a cable attaching it to the MBP!

Disconnect the SATA cable.

Remove the 2 T6 torx screws from each side of the hard drive (4 screws total) and transfer them to the new SSD.

## Step 3 - Connect the new SSD

Connect the SATA cable to the new SSD and place it back into the chassis.

Re-attach the retaining bar using the philips screwdriver.

## Step 4 - Put the MBP back together

Put the bottom of the MBP in place and use the philips screwdriver to tighten the 10 screws you removed to get it off. I'd start with the 3 longer screws.

And that should be you done!
