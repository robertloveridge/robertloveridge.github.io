If you're a manager of a 2nd/3rd line team that manages large volumes of projects/cases, it's a good idea to have a regular meeting to keep on-top of them so that all stakeholders are in the loop. Here's some ideas on a structure you could use.

Your team could gather twice a week for 15 minutes to discuss the current state of the projects/cases that have been escalated to you. The aim of these meetings will be to review the longer ongoing projects/cases that have been with your team for a while and to produce an action plan to get them closed.

## Before each meeting

Before each meeting, designate a team member to review each project/case on your list and pick out the longer running, more troublesome projects/cases.

After gathering a set of projects/cases to discuss, the designated team member should review them and prepare the below for each project/case:

 * The date it was originally escalated
 * The date of the last comment and the amount of time that's passed
 * A brief summary on what has been done so far

## During each meeting

When the meeting begins, the team member who did the pre-meeting review will take charge and each project/case will be discussed with an action plan put in place.

When discussing each project/case, make sure that each of the below points are touched upon:

 * Review the current projects/cases amount of projects/cases the owner has. This lets you know if you need to re-assign the project/case to another member of the team.
 * Review the current steps taken and what steps need to be taken to resolve the case.
 * Discuss and decide a day (in the near future) where this project/case will be prioritised. If possible, this should be resolved or further investigations should be done by the next backlog meeting.

## After each meeting

The designated team member should provide an update on all projects/cases that have been discussed so stakeholders are aware of the current status. This update should include the action plan and the estimated day of a further update.

If needed, you can then talk further with the owner of the project/case. This would be to either update them and answer any queries they may have but also to include them in the action plan if needs be.
