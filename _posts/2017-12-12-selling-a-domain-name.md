People buy and sell domain names all the time, according to Wikipedia, [insurance.com sold in 2010 for $35.6 million dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_domain_names) but for the average person, you're unlikely to make that much.

Here's the short story about the time I sold the first domain I ever owned, my dad bought it for me in 1998 when I first started building websites.

In February 2015, I received a letter from a letting agent in Burnley, they were looking for a domain name for their business and my domain name was perfect for them.

They were able to contact me because I didn't have WHOIS privacy on the domain and my postal address was listed.

Having WHOIS privacy on the domain is great if you want to hide your identity as the owner of a domain but for me, not having it enabled was the key to the sale of my domain.

I promptly replied to their letter by email and said that I'd be happy to sell my domain to them, I also put together [an agreement for both parties (12 KB Word Document)](/downloads/domain_purchase_agreement.docx) to sign and offered to help with the transfer in any way I could.

> Haggling over the price...

At first, I asked for what I thought was a fair price of £500. I knew I wasn't going to retire on the proceeds but I wanted to make it worthwhile.

They replied with a few counter offers of £150, £200 and then finally we agreed on £250 sale price for the domain.

> £250 sale price for the domain...

Although the domain was a short 4 letter domain name, it wasn't exactly premium so the price we agreed on was fair. It would have been great if I had sold it for thousands of pounds but I had fairly realistic price expectations.

RE Residential Lettings Ltd have gone on to make great use the domain name in ways I never did - my site was nearly always a holding page of [UK2.net](http://www.uk2.net) so selling the domain name was the right thing to do.

If you own a domain name that you've not used in a while, why not think about putting it up for sale?
