I used to be an extremely active person. I was a volunteer Police Officer between 2012 and 2014, so I had to be fit. For nearly 8 years, I trained at the gym three times a week and went to Judo and Ju-Jitsu twice a week.

Over the past couple of years I've done nothing! I've just kept on piling on the pounds and doing no exercise. I'm not overweight but definitely unfit.

I've overindulged in takeaways and I just love to eat rubbish - working in an office as a software developer means there's plenty of time to sit down and eat at my desk too!

What's my excuse? Lack of time, becoming a dad and wanting to spend time with my family, working far away from home - all great excuses but not really good enough, there should always be time!

So now I've started cutting out the junk food and building up on a basic exercise routine to get me back into shape.
