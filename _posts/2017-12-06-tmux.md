tmux is a useful way to maintain working states on remote servers. I use it at work a lot when I have a long running process that I want to come back to later. It allows me to detach and re-attach whenever I want. It's similar to `screen` but in my opinion, it's better.

## Running tmux

Again, I've assumed you're running a long-running process on a remote server and that the remote server has tmux on it. Connect to the remote server and type `tmux`.

By doing that, you have just created your first tmux session that you can disconnect from and come back to later.

```
[user@server ~]$ tmux
```

## List your sessions

One benefit of tmux is that you can run multiple sessions at the same time. If you're doing that, you'll need a way to see what sessions are available, so use the `ls` argument.

```
[user@server ~]$ tmux ls
```

The output will be something similar to:

```
0: 1 windows (created Wed Dec  6 22:06:27 2017) [63x13] (attached)
```

## Creating a new session

By default, your new session will be given a number to identify it but you can give a session a name if you want to.

You can create a new session with a name of your choice by using the `-s` argument and supplying a name for the session.

```
[user@server ~]$ tmux new -s my-long-running-process
```

## Connecting to an existing session

To connect to a session, you can type `tmux a` and it'll connect you to the first available session.

```
[user@server ~]$ tmux a
```

Or if you have given your session a name, you can attach to it using the name.

```
[user@server ~]$ tmux a -t my-long-running-process
```

## Detaching from a session

You can detach from an existing session by typing `detach`. This means that you can shut your terminal window and come back to that session later.

```
[user@server ~]$ tmux detach
```
