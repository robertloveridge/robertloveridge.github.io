It's up to you which editor you choose to use and write code with. Two popular options are [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/). I've used both of these but over the last year I've stuck with Atom - they both support good syntax highlighting, find and replace tools and built in package managers allowing you to extend the functionality and productivity of your environment.
