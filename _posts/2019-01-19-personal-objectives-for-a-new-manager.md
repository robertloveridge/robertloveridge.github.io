Before I started my role as Technical Lead at Rant and Rave, I put together a list of milestones/objectives for myself to help me in my first three months. I'm sharing that list with you here, I hope you find it useful.

## Personal Objectives

 * Functional line management of teams and individuals
 * Promotion of achievements, unlocking highest performance and potential at the individual level through personal development planning
 * Structured and complementary goal setting across individuals, pairs and teams supported by KPI measurement

## Before I start
