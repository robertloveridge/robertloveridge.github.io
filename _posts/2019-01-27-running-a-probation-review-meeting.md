Whenever I've run a probation review meeting, I've followed a similar process to the one described in this post. I'm putting it here because you might find it useful.

Within a probation period, the basics of the role should be under control; a good grasp of the broad business offering, strong ownership of the role, competence across the business administration and relationships developed with key clients and stakeholders.

The purpose of the probation review meeting is for the employee and the manager to discuss the probation period (usually 3 months in the UK) and highlight any areas that may need to be addressed as the employee moves forward to ongoing employment.

> As a manager, it's a good idea to ask for feedback on the employee from other team members - all with a view of sharing that (hopefully) positive feedback in the review.

Typically for a software development team, areas to think about are:

 * Planning, or lack of
 * Communication within the team, or wider business
 * Management of own work load
 * Understanding of the business expectations
 * Training - being proactive in trying to understand a problem or piece of functionality in the platform
 * Presentation and professionalism at work
 * Following through on tasks
 * Attention to detail in implementation of projects
 * Adherence to deadlines and process

During the probation review meeting, the employee should have an opportunity to tell you how they feel they are performing within the guidelines given for the role. Ask them what areas of their role they're enjoying, what areas (if any) are proving difficult.

At the end of the probation review meeting, as the manager, you should recap on the outcome and discuss appropriate training, retraining and timelines in an action plan.
