        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am currently working for Phocas Software as the Customer Support Manager, UK. I have many years of
            experience in Customer Support, Professional Services, Solution Design, Product Management, Software
            Development, and line management of multiple teams.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have worked for Gainsight, The Customer Success Company, as a Solutions Architect, and prior to working at
            Gainsight, I was the Head of Services at Upland Software where I managed the department in EMEA from our
            Coventry office. My department had 5 teams (19 people in total), and I reported to the General Manager EMEA.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a previous role (Product Management Team Lead) at Adestra, I worked with the Head of Product Management
            and COO on the product roadmap, facilitating meetings with the commercial teams every month so they were
            kept up to date on progress.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Upland, my team had revenue targets to meet, and my main focus was making sure that the projects we were
            managing were delivered on time and on budget. I acted as an escalation point for all clients who interacted
            with the team.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a software development background using the Perl programming language and PostgreSQL database, along
            with Git and Subversion for version control, and JIRA, Confluence, and BitBucket for development framework
            and sprint planning.
        </p>

        <p>
            When Upland Software acquired Adestra and Rant & Rave, I was involved in the employee consultations, so I
            have first-hand experience with detailing organisational changes in a sensitive manner.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm highly experienced in developing custom reporting and data integrations, having worked with many
            organisations on delivering technical solutions to real business challenges and goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy mentoring, problem-solving, and motivating myself, which I feel plays a key part in learning
            programming languages and creating bespoke solutions.
        </p>
