I'm available for 2 hours a week for free career advice, guidance, CV reviews, interview prep etc
------

**For free?**

I really enjoy mentoring people and seeing them achieve their goals, so I've set aside some time during my evenings where people can have a chat with me for 15 mins about their technical career. I might not have *the answer* but if you're struggling to get support from other sources, then hit me up! It's free advice and we'll chat over Google Hangouts.

**What kind of thing can we talk about?**

 * Career advice
 * CV reviews
 * Programming
 * Mentoring
 * Interviewing
