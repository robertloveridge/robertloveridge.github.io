        <td>I have never met someone so keen to help his colleagues grow. Rob has extensive technical knowledge and is always sharing this with the team. Every time I've needed his assistance, not only does he provide me with a solution but makes sure I'm confident with what he's explained. From the very first week he started, he quickly understood the challenges in the team & limitations within the tooling available and took it upon himself to create processes and scripts to make it easier for us. Whether there's a technical query, or a process query, Rob has always been the 'go to' man. He's brilliant - truly brilliant.</td>

I was lucky enough to work with Rob over many years and on numerous projects and knowing he was part of the team was a huge relief because you knew with him being involved it was going to be a success. He has a rare ability to mix his technical aptitude with point perfect planning skills and a common sense approach to everything. As you can probably tell, I cant speak highly enough of him.

        <td>I had the great pleasure of working with Rob at Adestra for around 3 years. You could not fail to be impressed by Rob's technical and product knowledge but for me, it was his ability to translate this knowledge into context for his wide variety of stakeholders. He did this by listening and really understanding his stakeholders needs. I also admired the strong relationships Rob had with his direct reports and others across the business. That's why, when it came to my maternity leave, I was super lucky to have Rob lead my team (Product Management). Rob did an amazing job juggling my maternity cover alongside his current role. He was a great support to the team day-to-day and in their transition to agile development. He keep me well-updated during my leave and we had smooth handovers either side; all contributing to a successful return-to-work for me (which I can't thank Rob enough for) and a great opportunity for Rob to experience Product Management and grow his awesome skill set further!</td>

He is always keen to learn about the technical (programming, databases, etc) aspects of the job, and also about team leadership. One thing I particularly admire is how cool he keeps when, say, system issues were making things difficult. I'd be very happy if we worked together again in the future.</td>

        <td>I've worked with Rob for the last 2 years, both as a colleague and also with him as my Line Manager. I can't commend Rob highly enough – as a Manager he's approachable, friendly, empathetic, is a great example to his direct reports and follows through on any promises he makes. I worked with him on several projects, where his knowledge and understanding of the systems we use and our platform, paid absolute dividends. If clients ever needed reassurance around how the platform would work for them, the Account Managers would wheel Rob out not just because of the level of knowledge he has, but also because of his wonderful communication style with our clients. Rob was definitely one of the “go to” guys in the company, and for that reason he won the Employee of the Year Awards on several occasions. He helped numerous people out, always without complaint, for which he was recognised with these Awards. Rob's a massive asset to any company, he'll be sorely missed by all in Adestra.</td>

        <td>Denise reported directly to Robert</td>
        <td>I worked with Rob for around 2 and a half years at Adestra and throughout that time Rob has been my inspiration. His dedication to his work and the huge amount of effort he makes to help others is what really pushed me to follow a similar career path. When I joined Adestra, I had no knowledge of databases or programming and no real interest in changing this. However, as I got more into the Support role and worked more alongside Rob and his team, my interest for this career grew and grew. Rob identified this from the beginning and made the effort (even though it wasn't part of his job role) to come and sit with me and go through any cases I had raised in further detail. By doing this, he really helped me develop my knowledge which in turn helped progress throughout the different departments. As a result of this, I have now become the technical solutions team leader. Rob is very knowledgable and is really good at transferring that knowledge on to others. In my time working with Rob, I never once saw him stress or complain at his work load or at the fact of helping others and this showed as he was a true source of motivation throughout the different departments and everyone in the business respects him. He never let the pressure of any of the work get to him or to any of his team and was always going above and beyond to sort out any queries that came his way, even if it meant he had to stay late or juggle a few things around. He was the one true guru at Adestra! As a manager, Rob is very approachable and I never had any problems raising any issues or concerns I had with him. I was happy to speak to him about anything and I felt as though he truly had my back in any issues we faced. Likewise, if I ever made any mistakes, I was never afraid of letting him know and I knew he would be there right away to help me resolve them. In short, Rob is a approachable, experienced manager who is always happy to get involved in the nitty gritty. Not only this, Rob is a fantastic, kind hearted person to be around who will always try to cheer you up when you are down. It has been a pleasure to work alongside him and he is definitely on his way to greater things!</td>

        <td>Throughout my time at Adestra, I have been lucky enough to work with Rob, the last 2 years being under his management. From the beginning, I was impressed with his technical knowledge & abilities accompanied by his friendly, helpful character. Rob's influence has been instrumental to the development of my career thus far, as he has closely mentored and coached me - the advice he has given over the years has been invaluable. I have collabarated with Rob not only on a vast array of internal and client projects, but also when aiding the Systems team in resolving any operational issues. I've never known a person who is as focused in pressured situations. Working with Rob, I always feel confident that we can deliver some creative and effective solutions. He demonstrates willingness to support his colleagues without fail, contributes & adapts to any change in the workplace with positivity and functions beyond expectation. As a manager, our department has controlled unexpectedly high volumes in workload. Rob has guided myself & other colleagues where lost and is there to talk to about any issues, not only work-related but also general well-being. Whilst sometimes it can be challenging to dissolve quandary, I've seen active improvements following his involvement. On a personal level, he is amiable and kind. He brings cheer and laughter to the office (as well as food treats for the team!). I could not be more thankful for a trustworthy colleague and one of the best managers I've had.</td>

        <td>I had the pleasure of working with Rob during my 2-year tenure at Adestra as an Account Manager. Rob used his vast knowledge and experience as a skilled developer to assist with the development of bespoke client projects, including complex integration into other systems and software. He also worked tirelessly in providing a level of technical support to escalated queries that needed the input of a developer to aid in resolutions. Rob has always had a clear vision and a methodical approach to his work - often questioning the scope of proposed projects to identify improvements and opportunities for new technologies and processes to be implemented that will benefit the client. Rob has continued to push himself in learning new languages and technologies to develop his skills, ensuring he is at the forefront of software and technology development. I would describe him as an trustworthy, intelligent, dedicated and enthusiastic in all he does. Rob has always been able to bond quickly with colleagues, knowing what motivates them and developing quick working relationships that really allow for complex projects to come to fruition in a timely manner - ultimately making the lives of those around him easier. He will be a valued asset to any company lucky enough to employ his services.</td>

Winner of many company awards at Adestra, I was fortunate to work closer with Rob in one of my roles within the company and more fully experienced and appreciated his vast knowledge in SQL, Perl and Console-based environments and owe my own skill in these areas to him entirely. When Rob is unavailable, you can certainly notice it within the company - his pools of experience, knowledge and friendly attitude really are a credit to him and any who have the fortune to work alongside him.</td>
