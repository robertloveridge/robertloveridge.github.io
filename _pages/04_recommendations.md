<h4>Denise Godfrey, System Engineer at Elsevier</h4>
    <div>
        <p>I worked with Rob for around 2 and a half years at Adestra and throughout that time Rob has been my inspiration. His dedication to his work and the huge amount of effort he makes to help others is what really pushed me to follow a similar career path.</p>
        <p>When I joined Adestra, I had no knowledge of databases or programming and no real interest in changing this. However, as I got more into the Support role and worked more alongside Rob and his team, my interest for this career grew and grew. Rob identified this from the beginning and made the effort (even though it wasn't part of his job role) to come and sit with me and go through any cases I had raised in further detail. By doing this, he really helped me develop my knowledge which in turn helped progress throughout the different departments. As a result of this, I have now become the technical solutions team leader.</p>
        <p>Rob is very knowledgable and is really good at transferring that knowledge on to others. In my time working with Rob, I never once saw him stress or complain at his work load or at the fact of helping others and this showed as he was a true source of motivation throughout the different departments and everyone in the business respects him. He never let the pressure of any of the work get to him or to any of his team and was always going above and beyond to sort out any queries that came his way, even if it meant he had to stay late or juggle a few things around. He was the one true guru at Adestra!</p>
        <p>As a manager, Rob is very approachable and I never had any problems raising any issues or concerns I had with him. I was happy to speak to him about anything and I felt as though he truly had my back in any issues we faced. Likewise, if I ever made any mistakes, I was never afraid of letting him know and I knew he would be there right away to help me resolve them.</p>
        <p>In short, Rob is a approachable, experienced manager who is always happy to get involved in the nitty gritty. Not only this, Rob is a fantastic, kind hearted person to be around who will always try to cheer you up when you are down. It has been a pleasure to work alongside him and he is definitely on his way to greater things!</p>

        <p>We as a company are very demanding of Robert's time but he always adopts a 'can-do' attitude. His work always meets our requirements and he has a good understanding of how our business works. He is efficient and always works in a professional manor.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Carl Chambers, Regional Director APAC at Adestra</h4>
    <div>
        <p>I had the pleasure of working with Rob for many years and seeing his career develop over his time at Adestra.</p>
        <p>Rob is a true team player and will always go out of his way to help those around him. He has a unique blend of leadership capability in combination with deep technical understanding and the ability to deliver fantastic client facing customer service.</p>
        <p>He's an absolutely star and I would love to work with Rob again in the future.</p>

    <h4>Ian Berry, Senior Project Manager at PCMS Group</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Within days of starting at Rant & Rave, Rob had established himself as an integral member of the team. He has now worked with me on numerous customer projects and change requests, each time getting great feedback from our clients. His technical knowledge is outstanding. A wholly dependable and professional person to work with.</p>

    <h4>Simon Bannister, Head of Email Marketing at GTI Media</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Rob's excellent grasp of technology and desire to help everybody makes him one of the most valuable people I have ever worked with. He always goes that extra mile to make sure he meets and exceeds the expectations of his colleagues and his clients.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Jonathan Hall, Engineering Team Lead at Sage People</h4>
    <div>
        <p>It's rare you come across someone like Robert.</p>
        <p>Robert is a broad-minded, honest, careful and efficient team player. I have worked with him for many years and it has been a real pleasure. His ability to analyse data, problem solve and his team management skills is a great benefit to the business.</p>
        <p>He is ready to deal with difficult situations and solve the problems on time. </p>

    <h4>Bradley Margerrison, Application Developer at Captec Systems</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Throughout my time at Adestra, I have been lucky enough to work with Rob, the last 2 years being under his management. From the beginning, I was impressed with his technical knowledge & abilities accompanied by his friendly, helpful character. Rob's influence has been instrumental to the development of my career thus far, as he has closely mentored and coached me - the advice he has given over the years has been invaluable.</p>
        <p>I have collabarated with Rob not only on a vast array of internal and client projects, but also when aiding the Systems team in resolving any operational issues. I've never known a person who is as focused in pressured situations. Working with Rob, I always feel confident that we can deliver some creative and effective solutions. He demonstrates willingness to support his colleagues without fail, contributes & adapts to any change in the workplace with positivity and functions beyond expectation.</p>
        <p>As a manager, our department has controlled unexpectedly high volumes in workload. Rob has guided myself & other colleagues where lost and is there to talk to about any issues, not only work-related but also general well-being. Whilst sometimes it can be challenging to dissolve quandary, I've seen active improvements following his involvement.</p>
        <p>On a personal level, he is amiable and kind. He brings cheer and laughter to the office (as well as food treats for the team!).</p>
        <p>I could not be more thankful for a trustworthy colleague and one of the best managers I've had.</p>
