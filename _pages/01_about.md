I am currently a Senior Manager at Upland Software, working in the Global CXM Services Operations team. I had previously worked as the Head of Services at Upland Software CXM EMEA and I have 12+ years experience in software development, including line management of multiple teams and mentoring junior developers.

As Head of Services, I managed a department in EMEA from our Coventry office, my department had 5 teams (19 people in total) and I reported to the General Manager EMEA.

In a previous role (Product Management Team Lead) at Adestra, I worked with the Head of Product Management and COO on the product roadmap, facilitating meetings with the commercial teams every month so they were kept up-to-date on the progress.

More recently at Upland, my team has revenue targets to meet and my main focus is making sure that the projects we are managing are delivered on time and on budget. I act as escalation point for all clients who interact with us.

I have a software development background using Perl programming language and PostgreSQL database, Git and Subversion for Version Control, JIRA, Confluence and BitBucket for development framework and sprint planning.

When Upland Software acquired Adestra and Rant & Rave, I was involved in the employee consultations, so I have first hand experience with detailing out organisational changes in a sensitive manner.

I’m highly experienced in developing custom reporting and data integrations, having worked with many organisations on delivering technical solutions to real business challenges and goals.

I enjoy mentoring, problem solving and motivating myself, which I feel plays a key part in learning programming languages and creating bespoke solutions.

Having received positive feedback from Adestra’s Leadership team and being seen as a reference point by other senior managers and colleagues across the organisation, I was voted Adestra's employee of the year in 2007, 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018.
